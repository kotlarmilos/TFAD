# Meta features for anomaly detection

This repository presents decision support system for detecting anomalies using meta features.

With exponential growth of data and devices, detecting anomalies in data become essential task for many domains. Detecting anomalies is a non trivial task 
which could be performed using various groups of algorithms. Decision support systems for model selection aims to overcome complexity by prosing the best algorithm 
for a given task using meta learning approach.

By using different kinds of metadata, like properties of the learning problem, algorithm properties, or patterns previously derived from the data, 
it is possible to select different learning algorithms to effectively solve a given problem. Such an approach is also used in recommendation systems 
where recommendations are made based on metadata, consisting of characteriza- tions of these datasets. These characterizations, also called meta features, 
describe properties of the data which are predictive for the performance of algorithms trained on them.

The main research question answered in this paper applies to possibility to define a set of meta features which would characterize anomalies in data. 
Decision support systems would be able to predict the best algorithm for a given task with a given time budget using proposed meta features, 
where the goals are to use minimal level of information and minimal computational effort.

This repository is part of ongoing research which will be publised soon and it is subject to change.
Once the research is completed, the detailed instructions with examples and datasets will be available.
